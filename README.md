## 🚀 Project Features

### 🌅 Sun Tracking
- **LDR sensors** to detect sun direction.
- **Servo motor** to rotate the solar panel.
- **Limit switches** to define rotation boundaries.

### 💧 Automatic Solar Panel Cooling
- **Motor pump** controlled by **relay**.
- Activates based on solar panel temperature or manual trigger.
  
### ⚡ Power Supply & Control
- **LM2596 buck converter**: Steps down 12V to 5V.
- **L298D Motor Driver**: Controls a geared DC motor for mechanical movement.

### 📡 Future Scope
- **IoT Monitoring via WiFi** using ESP32.
- Cloud-based data logging (e.g., Firebase, MQTT, Blynk).
